    <div class="summary-paragraph">
      <p>Push Cloud storage is a unique tool used by approximately over 2
      million people all over the world, and it that number continues to
      increase as the needs of users grow. People use cloud storage both
      their personal and professional lives. The goal of PUSH is to
      provide a seamless user experience and appealing design that fits
      the needs of all users no matter what their lifestyle is.</p>
      <p>My process for this project entailed entensive research, persona
      creation, User stories and sitemaps. In Figma I developed Low and
      Hi fidelity wireframes and mockups as well as an interactive
      prototype using Invision.</p>

      <h1>Problem</h1>
      <div class="underline"></div>
      <p>Cloud storage users want a safe and reliable
      space to store their memories, work, music and more.
      There are many options out there, but users still
      face a number of frustrations. My research showed
      that users want better security measures, and a reliable
      system that won't fail them if their wifi goes down.
      Complicated organization, and saving links are among those
      frutrations. Collaboration was also crucial to work teams.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
      <h1>Solution</h1>
      <div class="underline"></div>
      <p>My research indicated a highly diverse
      audience that represented every kind of user. With
      extensive research the solution resulted in an app that
      inspired easy organization through Folders and Categories
      only. PUSH provides a secure offline version so users can
      work offline,and when it comes to our users feeling safe
      while sharing, they can depend on several layers of security.
      These features include expiration and a 6 digit custom code.</p>

        them to work by testing  several times with participants. On the low fidelity
        wireframes, some particpants found that navigating was easy and understood the
        product’s purpose. I moved on to creating hi-fi wireframes and the feedback
        indicated that the naviagtion system was not as clear, participants were confused

        <p>Once I moved onto the first round of mockups, color and typography
        were added. I created a clickable prototype with invision and tested.
        The participants were excited at first by the visuals but it soon proved
        to be overstimulating. The gradients looked cool but it caused confusion
        and distraction and the navigation was not a solid system, particularly
        for the homepage, participans had a very hard time figuring out where to
        go and how to get back to certain pages. With this feedback I was forced
        to <span class="pause">take a pause for the cause!<span> I stepped back

      we had a clean, relaxing feel to the design. The gradient really distracted
      users and made it hard and confusing to figure out what they needed to do
      next. I went from gradients, abstract background, to using illustrations

    <h1>Leassons learned</h1>
    <p>The cloud storage is a booming industry and it doesn’t look like it’s
    slowing down any time soon. Designing and creating outstanding products
    cannot be taken lightly nor can we settle for mediocre apps that do not
    make the lives of our users easier. The competition is tough, really tough.
    Although the benefit of competition is that we discover our strengths
    and weaknesses and realize that we are capable of creating a better
    product by being different and putting our users first, maintaining
    user-centered mindsets and implementing design thinking.</p>
    <p>Through my design process I found that overstimulating users can be a majro distraction,
    so much so that their experience with the product is poor. I quickly became obsessed with
    what’s trending, what looks cool, what are other designers doing, how can I make this
    thing as colorful as possible? To finally come to the end, crash and burn. After revisiting
    my surveyed, analysis and doing more testing I came back to what the goal was, what
    solution I needed. I revamped the entire product from some of the major wireframes (Landing page)
    to the icons, buttons and color palette. The users went insane, they instantly felt the
    growth of the project and dove right in without hesitation, it’s as if they used the product
    before, they loved it. It was clean, easy and aesthetically appealing. I constantly called,
    chatted and asked questions and requested explanations. I allowed them to co-create with me
    and that was my biggest accomplishment, by doing this  I was able to jump into the minds of
    my users beyond testing and interviews and let them guide the creation of PUSH, I just did the
    dirty work, happily course. Now I look at the original vision and though it’s embarrassing that
    I even thought that it could possibly work! I literally placed my users in a psychedelic hologram
    but I’m proud to say I had major growth and was able to go back to square one and in life my users.</p>
