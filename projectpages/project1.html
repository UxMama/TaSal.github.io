    <div class="problem">
      <h1>Project Summary</h1>
      <p>Cloud storage users want a safe and reliable
      space to store their memories, work, music and more.
      There are many options out there, but users still
      face a number of frustrations. My research showed
      that users want better security measures, and a reliable
      system that won't fail them if their wifi goes down.
      Complicated organization, and saving links are among those
      frustrations and easy collaboration was also crucial to work teams.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
      <h1>Solution</h1>
      <p>My research indicated a highly diverse
      audience that represented every kind of user. With
      extensive research the solution resulted in an app that
      inspired easy organization through folders and categories
      only. PUSH provides a secure offline version so users can
      work offline,and when it comes to our users feeling safe
      while sharing, they can depend on several layers of security.
      These features include expiration and a 6 digit custom code.</p>

          <p class="compresults">• Compatible across all operating systems</p>

      and retesting several times would ensure the design was user-friendly.</p>
      <p>After I conducted the usability tests for the prototype, there were still
      a few things that needed to be improved to ensure a seamless experience.

       found a system that was familiar, functional, using a top navigation through a breadcrumb style navigation</span>.
       I also decided to use images that were much more relatable to individuals who would use this type of product. Push
       went from multi-colored gradients, abstract backgrounds, and illustrations, to
       powerful photography and strong content that connected the users to
     the product.</p><br><br>

       <p><span style="color:
#076DCF;font-weight:bold">ROUND 2:</span> I added color and typography
       and created clickable prototypes with invision and tested the
       first version of my design once again.The participants were excited by the colors at first glance but it soon proved
       to be overstimulating.
       <br>The gradients caused confusion and users were so distracted. The feedback also showed that the navigation was not a solid, users did not understand
       whether these were links, tabs, buttons or what would happen when they clicked.
       <span class="color"> I decided to use only two colors for gradient, and subtle
       highlight indicator for the selection they were on in the dashboard. This tested very well and users were much more pleased with the Navigation

      <p>The name PUSH was inspired by some of the participants. I asked three
      simple questions to provoke more freedom during their thought process. Instead of
      overwhelming them with a ton of questions, I wanted to focus on the end goal which is
      how they feel or how they connect to the product they are using.<span class= "brand"> What do you think of when using a cloud storage?
      What do you think of when it comes to WHY you are using the cloud
      storage app? What emotion do you associate with it?</span></p>
      <p>PUSH represents the motivation, confidence and connection that users
      want to achieve and experience while using this product. It also represents
      the literal pushing of files, documents, links, videos etc into the cloud.

    <br><br>After revisiting my surveys, analysis and performing more testing I came back to what the goal
    actually was, and what solution was needed. I revamped the entire product from some of the major
    wireframes to the icons, buttons and color palette.<span class= "failed"> I implemented familiarity when it came
