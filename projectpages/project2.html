      <h1>PROBLEM</h1>
      <p>Herbal teas have been a big trend for the last few years and we see new ones
      hitting the shelves all the time. My client needed to solidify and requested an
      e-commerce store design to shed light on the possibilities of promoting and growing his product and brand. Health Hooch is a homemade
      herbal tonic with major health benefits The goal was to provide a user-friendly, aesthetically appealing online store,
      and an easy shopping experience where consumers can shop for the product but also gain
      knowledge about the ingredients and benefits. The functional, clean design as well as strong brand development will be introduced to
      investors, and manufactures. My client also plans to apply the design to his designated e-commerce platform. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h1>SOLUTION</h1>
      <p>After going over details of the project and having in-depth conversation about the brand I was able to
      provide a user-friendly, bright and organized online store design. I also developed a brand that sends a message of strength
      and health. Health Hooch not only provides organic and safe products to consumers but they also learn
      while they're shopping. The store gives users an option to subscribe to a monthly plan or shop
      as guests giving them more purchasing power and freedom, which we believe will result in loyal subscribers.</p>

Status: Married with 1 daughter
fun-Fact: He and his family are Organic-Vegans</p>
<p class="persona-motivations">Motivations:
Keeping his family away from toxins in clothing, food and household items brings
 him peace andmakes him feel good that they are healthy inside and out! They are
 always on a mission to find companies that use homegrown, organic products.</p>
 <p class="persona-frustrations">Frustrations:
Amadi has a hard time finding kid friendly products without soy and make it
easier on the wallet. Buying completely seperate foods and drinks for “adults”
and “kids” can be expensive, especially organic health products. An all family
member item is desired.</p>
<p class="persona-goals">Goals:He would like to find a go to  product that fits his family's
  budget and diet requirements.</p>
<p class="persona-qoute">Amadi says:
  “People think it’s easy for me to be healthy and keep
  my family healthy because I’m a doctor! It’s hard for us too because we can’t
  always find certain things that fit all of us as a unit, it has nothing to do

<p class="persona-qoute">Blythe says: “So this ‘food can heal’ concept, really has my
attention. I know that there are natural medicines but if I can eat or drink certain
things that target specific ailments or just make me healthier, it would be cool to find
them at college student prices!”</p>

      I performed multiple tests with users to gain a better understanding of their movements in an
      e-commerce store and to find out which areas needed more work. I started with the paper prototype for many reasons;
      it invloves the user at an early stage, and assisted with rapid evaluations and testing. After paper prototypes
      I had users test with an invision prototype. The results indicated that the design offered a smooth experience for the users,
     although a few changes were necessary such as the ability favorite a product, and simplifying the checkout process. </p>

    <div class="branding">
      <p>Branding was very interesting! I had the chance to really dive into the history of Hooch.
      I could see where the product stood out compared to it's competitors. Hooch is originally a potent
      alcoholic beverage usually made in the woods because it is highly illegal. Names that most people are familiar
      with are: Moonshine, white lightning, mountain dew, choop, homebrew, shiney, or white whiskey. With that in
      mind, we knew that the route we wanted to take Health Hooch was a rugged, dark and natural theme. </p>

    <h1 class="logo-title">LOGO<br>DESIGN</h1>
    <div class="logo-container">
      <p class="logo-paragraph">I performed market research on 4 other logo
      designs from our competitors. Once I figured out the direction we were aiming for, my client and I
      took another look at a few more logos from competitors and incorporated things that we
      liked from each. This was strictly experimental and helped us learn what we liked, what
      worked and what respresented the brand best. I moved on to sketches and worked our way
      down to 3 final sketches and placed them on packaging mockups to make our final decision.
      The current logo name is enclosed inside large typeface of the same letter, simple but creative, this
      worked well for marketing and trending names like "HH". A ring around the name was added, which represents
      the bottom of a mason jar, which hooch is closely associated with. To ensure our users understood
      that this is a healthy product I added custom vector leaves at the bottom of the ring. </p>

     The color palette was fairly easy to accomplish, although there was hesitation
     on different shades of each color selected. We wanted to ensure that we were capturing
     the boldness of Health Hooch through it's colors. So nature colors were selected but darker
     hues were chosen to represent the rugged, and woodsy feeling.

     I chose Oswald for it's origin in classic gothic and grotesque styles of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
     Oswald is available in light, normal and bold weights. I felt that this typeface fit perfectly with the bold and masculine brand created for Health Hooch.
     I decided to pair it with an easy to read and versatile typeface, Open Sans Hebrew, used only for body context. </p>

          of Health Hooch, particularly the landing page which contained all of the information a consumer
          would need when visiting a new store. I took this approach to eliminate having to visit several
          different pages to find the products or educational resources they need. These two versions were tested
          as we were also trying to decided on possible packaging products. The 3 Bottle landing page blew version 1
          out of the water! Users loved the sleek look and really enjoyed the liquor bottle packaging for a non-alcoholic
          health drink.

    <p class="learned-paragraph"> This project introduced me to the e-commerce business and how
      important design and brand are when it comes to growing a business like this. I also learned
      that even in a saturated market there is still enough room for aspiring entreprenuers to introduce
      their products to consumer, as long as they have a unique twist to stand out. The client relationship
      was phenomenal and really opened my eyes to the needs of a client who has trusted me with delivering
      their message in a memorable way. The research that I performed, taught me alot about how users shop
      online vs in store and aided me in providing the best solution to enhance their online shopping experience.
