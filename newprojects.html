      <h1>PROBLEM</h1>
      <p>Cloud storage users want a safe and reliable
      space to store their memories, work, music and more.
      There are many options out there, but users still
      face a number of frustrations. My research showed
      that users want better security measures, and a reliable
      system that won't fail them if their wifi goes down.
      Complicated organization, and saving links are among those
      frutrations. Collaboration was also crucial to work teams.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
      <h1>SOLUTION</h1>
      <p>My research indicated a highly diverse
      audience that represented every kind of user. With
      extensive research the solution resulted in an app that
      inspired easy organization through Folders and Categories
      only. PUSH provides a secure offline version so users can
      work offline,and when it comes to our users feeling safe
      while sharing, they can depend on several layers of security.
      These features include expiration and a 6 digit custom code.</p>

        that navigating was easy and understood the product’s purpose. I moved on to creating
        hi-fi wireframes and the feedback indicated that the naviagtion system was not as clear,

    <div class="branding">
      <p>The name PUSH was inspired by some of the participants. I asked three
      simple questions to provoke a clearer thinking process. I wanted to
      focus on the end goal which is how they feel or how they connect to
      the product they are using<span class= "brand"> What do you think of when using a cloud storage?
      What do you think of when it comes to WHY you are using the cloud
      storage app? What emotion do you associate with it.</span></p>
      <p>PUSH represents the motivation, confidence and connection that users
      want to achieve and experience while using this product. It also represents
      the literal pushing of files, documents, links, videos etc into the cloud.
      From there, things were moving on up and my product started to take shape,but
      not without trial and error.</p>

       With the concept of “Pushing files”, it was necessary to use
       a font that was tech related, Share Tech was perfect and paired with an
       easy to read and beautiful typeface, Montserrat. Share Tech is used
       mostly for headlines and subheads and all of text following is Montserrat,
       the combination engages the users and allows them to find and understand

    <h1 class="title">WHAT I<br>LEARNED</h1>

      <div class="learn">
    <p class="learned-paragraph">Through my design process I found that overstimulating
    users can be a major distraction, resulting in a poor experience. I  became obsessed
    with what’s trending, what looks cool, how can I make this thing as colorful
    as possible? To finally come to the end, crash and burn. After revisiting my surveys,
    analysis and performing more testing I came back to what the goal really was, and
    what solution I needed. I revamped the entire product from some of the major
    wireframes (Landing page) to the icons, buttons and color palette. The users
    instantly felt the growth of the project and dove right in without hesitation,
    it was as if they used the product before. It was clean, easy and aesthetically
    appealing. I constantly called, chatted and asked questions and requested explanations.
    My biggest accomplisment and "aha!" moment, was when I alized how much value there is in
    allowing the users to co-create. I am happy to say that as I learned about the users of
    this product, I also learned valuable lessons that will carry over into all of my future
    ux projects.
