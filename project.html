          <h1>Summary</h1>
          <p> Push Cloud storage is a unique tool used by approximately over 2 million people all over the world,<br>
and it that number continues to increase as the needs of users grow. People use cloud storage both<br>
their personal and professional lives.The goal of PUSH is to provide a seamless user experience and<br>
appealing design that fits the needs of all users no matter what their lifestyle is. My process for this<br>
 project entailed entensive research, persona creation, User stories and sitemaps. In Figma<br>
I developed Low and Hi fidelity wireframes and mockups as well as an interactive prototype using Invision.<br><br>

My Roles for this project included UX/UI Design and Research, Branding Visual Design,and Interaction Design.<br>
Deliverables included Layered design file for all mockups, Static assets, Clickable prototype, Branding details,<br>
SVG and native file format, layered style guide, SVG and PNG Black-and-white versions of all logo variations,<br>
SVG and PNG Color versions of all logo variations, User testing, wireframes, and competative analysis.</p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>When it comes to cloud storage users<br>
              want a safe and reliable space to<br>
              store their memories, work, music etc.<br>
              Though there are many options out there,<br>
              users still found faced a number of<br>
              frustrations.Through my research I found<br>
              that users are still seeking an app that<br>
              offers multiple layers of security ,and a<br>
              reliable system  that won't fail them if their<br>
              wifi goes down. Organization sometimes<br>
              became headaches for users and a decrease<br>
              in productivty becomes an issue when they<br>
              don’t have access to collaboration methods.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>My research indicated a highly diverse<br>
            audience that represented every kind of<br>
            user.I had to ensure the Cloud storage app<br>
            met their needs. With extensive research the<br>
            solution resulted in an app that inspired<br>
            easy organizationthrough Folders and Categories<br>
            only. PUSH provides a secure offline version<br>
            so users can work offline,and when it comes to<br>
            our users feeling safe while sharing, they<br>
            can depend on several layers of security.<br>
            These features include expiration and a<br>
            6 digit custom code.</p>

          <h1>Discovery & Research Phase</h1>
          <h2>User Surveys</h2><p> The importance and necessity<br>
          of having a cloud storage app reflected through<br>
          the data I received from surveys. Below are a<br>
          few numbers that I felt represented the need of<br>
          cloud storage and the audience I was aiming for.<br>
          Participants were asked questions like: Which<br>
          cloud storage they currently used, what were<br>
          their favorites features, concerns they had when<br>
          using cloud storage and how they used their<br>
          storage?</p>

          <p>Persona Creation After retrieving the data from<br>
          my survey and reviewing it, I was able to create<br>
          Personas based on the demands of real users. I placed<br>
          the Users’ needs first in order to help determine how<br>
          the product will fit the convention requirements of<br>
          users in different demographics. I also found that<br>
          having the Personas provided a tool for me that would<br>
          remind me of the user’s needs and assist in creating<br>
          a better user experience that users will feel<br>
          confident using.</p>

          my sketches by hand and moved onto creating them in Figma.<br>
          When the wireframes were done, I put them to work by<br>
          testing a few times with participants. The participants found<br>
          the flow very easy to navigate through and understand the<br>
          product. I moved on to creating hi-fi wireframes which is<br>
          where PUSH was reborn within the design process. The feedback<br>
          indicated that the colors looked cool but it was so<br>
          confusing and distracting. The second issue was a navigation system,<br>
          so I spent a considerable amount of time ensuring there was<br>
          a solid system in place.<br>

          <p>After I conducted the usability tests for my prototype,<br>

              on a rectangular shape looks as if they could be buttons or links.<br>

• Shorten the length of the list when the + is activated to create, upload etc.<br>
I noticed hesitation on the users end when the drop-down list was presented<br>
and I want to eliminate that feeling.<br>

• Add another + in the list of files section and designate that as a create<br>
 a new folder or category for organization.<br>

• The sign-up page was confusing for the first few users.  They were confused<br>
 about whether they should fill in the fields and then select the plans -OR-<br>
 review and select the plans and move onto completing the information fields.<br>

• Create icons that are complimentary sizes for sizes for the label buttons,<br>
previews of folders, files, and categories.<br>

          <section class="Branding and Identity">
          <h2>Branding & Identity</h2>
          <p>The name PUSH was inspired by some of my participants. I thought<br>
             it was suitable to keep it simple by asking them three questions.<br>
              I wanted to focus on the end goal which is how they feel or how<br>
              they connect to the product they are using. I only asked three<br>
              questions: What do you think of when using a cloud storage?<br>
              What do you think of when it comes to WHY you are using the cloud<br>
              storage app? What emotion do you associate with it.<br><br>

            PUSH represents the motivation, confidence and feelings that  users want to<br>
            achieve and experience while using this product. It also represents the literal<br>
           pushing of files, documents, links, videos etc into the cloud. From there,<br>
           things were movin’ on up and my product started to take shape, but not without<br>
          trial and error.<br>

              <p>PUSH Evolved from blue, teal, pink and purple gradients to a
                clean medium blue, use of calming grays and a splash of accent
                colors like yellow. I wanted my users to feel calm, less stressed
                 and Confident using this product. The use of white space really
                  helped clean up the design and allowed for more functionality

                 <p>Since I went with the concept of “Pushing files” I wanted

                    I paired this with a simple, easy to read and beautiful typeface,
                     Montserrat. Share Tech is used mostly for headlines and
                     subheads and all of text following is Montserrat, the combination
                      engages the users and allows them to find and understand

              a  system that was familiar, functional and created an easy and
              pleasing experience. I removed things like rounded corners, shadows,
               and anything that dated the app. My love for gradient became a
               disaster but once removed we had a clean, relaxing feel to the design.
                The gradient really distracted users and made it hard and confusing
                 to figure out what they needed to do next. I went from gradients,
                  abstract background, to using illustrations and finally decided

          <h2>What I learned</h2>
          <p>The cloud storage is a booming industry and it doesn’t look like it’s
             slowing down any time soon. Designing and creating outstanding products
              cannot be taken lightly nor can we settle for mediocre apps that do not
               make the lives of our users easier. The competition is tough, really tough.
                Although the benefit of competition is that we discover our strengths
                 and weaknesses and realize that we are capable of creating a better
                 product by being different and putting our users first, maintaining
                 user-centered mindsets and implementing design thinking.

Through my design process I found that overstimulating users can be a majro distraction,
 so much so that their experience with the product is poor. I quickly became obsessed with
  what’s trending, what looks cool, what are other designers doing, how can I make this
  thing as colorful as possible? To finally come to the end, crash and burn. After revisiting
   my surveyed, analysis and doing more testing I came back to what the goal was, what
   solution I needed. I revamped the entire product from some of the major wireframes (Landing page)
    to the icons, buttons and color palette. The users went insane, they instantly felt the
    growth of the project and dove right in without hesitation, it’s as if they used the product
    before, they loved it. It was clean, easy and aesthetically appealing. I constantly called,
    chatted and asked questions and requested explanations. I allowed them to co-create with me
    and that was my biggest accomplishment, by doing this  I was able to jump into the minds of
    my users beyond testing and interviews and let them guide the creation of PUSH, I just did the
    dirty work, happily course. Now I look at the original vision and though it’s embarrassing that
     I even thought that it could possibly work! I literally placed my users in a psychedelic hologram
