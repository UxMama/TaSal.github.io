        <h1>Hi, I'm Tasha!</h1>
        <p>I’m a <span class="highlight">UX Deigner</span> who never gets bored with resolving multi-faceted problems
        and loves to influence others through technology and design. I am also
        Sociology major at Texas Woman’s University, a really cool mom, an amazing  wife.
        In a nutshell, I’m <span class="highlight">Superhuman.</span></p>

        <div class="journey">
          <h1>MY JOURNEY INTO UX</h1>
          <p>I am the product of <span class="highlight">artists</span> and <span class="highlight">thinkers</span>. Growing up, I was always drawing,
          painting, and trying to figure out how my art could make someone else happy. I dabbled in photoshop and altered images, or created my own magazines, wrote
          poetry and always found myself <span class="highlight">navigating</span> others through their problems, and some form of
          art was always at the end my guidance. I’ve always been creative and inquisitive, and
          these qualities folllowed me throughout life and lent themselves to my strong work ethic
          and passion for <span class="highlight">helping others.</span></p>
          <p>With <span class="highlight">10 years</span> in Client Relations and my most recent endeavor as a Real Estate agent,
          I became heavily involved in photography and designing marketing products. Bloc introduced me
          to the world of UX and UI, the perfect union of <span class="highlight">creativity</span> and <span class="highlight">thoughtfulness.</span>
          This combination allows me to explore the many realms of visual creativity but also deliver
          an extraordinary experience for humans, where it actually matters.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="philosophy">
          <h1>MY DESIGN PHILOSOPHY</h1>
          <p>I believe that design solutions can benefit <span class="highlight">humanity</span> on a global
          scale, through in depth reasearch and a deep understanding of humans. I want to create
          products that reach out and <span class="highlight">empower</span> every culture, every disabilty, future generations
          and every kind of person. Like our minds, design has no limitations, only <span class="highlight"solutions</span>
          for now as well as for the future.</p>
          <p>Though I enjoy research more than anything, I value the relationship
          with <span class="highlight">developers</span> and <span class="highlight">technology experts.</span>
          This relationship helps in the decision making during the design process as well as validating
          ideas and confirming the ability to deliver on time and on budget.</p>
          <p>Lastly, <span class="highlight">simplicity.</span> Everyone can appreciate the idea of simplicity, what <span class="highlight">intrigues</span>
          me is that it can be more difficult to create something that is, simple. Simplicity creates
          experiences that allow the users to complete a task or accomplish goals in the easiest, most pleasant
          way. This can only be achieved by having a deep <span class="highlight">understanding</span>
          of the users, knowing their needs and welcoming <span class="highlight">co-creation</span>. I enjoy the
          challenge that UX offers,and I am continously striving to be a better designer in every moment.</p>
