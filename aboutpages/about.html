  <div class="biography">
  <p>One year ago, my family and I PCS’d to Texas. Our last few months in Florida, I was preparing to take the exam to become a Real Estate Agent. When I arrived, I immediately thought I was jumping into my “dream” job, finally! Real Estate had been on my mind for years and I had the opportunity to dive in and become a major Real Estate guru, so I thought. Well, long story short it didn’t take me long to realize that what was true to my heart wasn’t Real Estate, but the experience clients go through. As I plugged away at listings, showings, and client to client, I watched these poor dream seeking people go through a horrendous process of reaching the goal of Homeownership. After long days of driving from city to city, I came home every night and told myself, “this is supposed to be exciting.” Of course, making a big purchase can be stressful, but I never went into Real Estate with the belief that the stress should at any point, outweigh the excitement of becoming a homeowner. The trails of paperwork, broken apps that clients were sent to, confusing web pages, talking to 3-4 people before they could get to their agent, digital locks not opening. All of these seemed to take away from the great experience these clients must have, to remain encouraged.<br><br>

  <p>Only eight months into Real Estate, I could no longer be part of this soul-sucking experience. So, I quit, no questions asked, no hesitation. Then I sat for a while, a few months actually, and as I sat, I started to key in on how I approached everyday tasks, what I was seeking as a user, client or customer. I needed the experience to be superb, to make my crazy military-life, military-wife, with two young kids and a husband who's gone for half the year… easier.  Not only that, I realized how much it bothered me when someone else’s experience was less than mediocre. It bothered me to my core, so much so I would google how to enhance one's experience, or how to help people better with everyday tasks. In one of my "googling" sessions, I came across an ad for a Coding program, and all of a sudden, my mind was flooded with memories. In Highschool, I would dabble in photoshop and alter images all day, burn cd after cd and pass them out to my friends with the freshest playlist available, or create my own magazines just for fun. Then into adulthood, came plugins and deep linking on sites like Wix, and becoming involved in photography and marketing. It rushed back as if someone turned on a light bulb and lit up a room that was apparently dark the entire time.
  From that ad, I started looking into more programs and quickly found that I was immediately drawn to UX/UI research and design. Everything finally made sense. I realized that my passion lies within serving others. I’m happy when I can help others and make a change in how they experience pretty much anything. Bloc introduced me to the world of UX and UI, the perfect union of creativity and thoughtfulness. This combination allows me to explore the many realms of visual creativity but also deliver an extraordinary experience for humans, where it matters.<br><br>

  <p>With my newly acquired skills, I have major plans to take on the World one human at a time. I see myself working within educational systems to improve student resources that will engage and motivate them. Also, assisting veterans with medical benefits and asset management is important to me because I see firsthand the work that needs to be done to take care of them. I want to inspire spirituality through products that encourage a greener Earth and healthy minds. Building a brighter, more diverse future for our younger generation is also in my master plan. Technology is our future, and it’s not slowing down. I believe that design solutions can benefit humanity on a global scale, I know that it will take a very high degree of focus, a lot of work, and time but that’s a journey I’m ready to take.</p>
